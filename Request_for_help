I  would appreciate some feedback.  I am confident that I have modified the code properly.
However, it does not seem to be executing properly.

I have named the matrix variable "invmat"
When I execute using:  cacheSolve(makeCacheMatrix(testdata1))
	it returns an error that "object 'invmat' not found"
	I will explicitly run the initialization line and it appears in as defined variable
		in my environment
		When I run the initial function again, it returns another error:
			"Error in solve.default(data, ...) : 'a' (8 x 1) must be square"
			
Additionally, I have tried to walk through the step by step commands, but with 
similar results:


	> aMatrix <- makeCacheMatrix(1:4)
> 	aMatrix$getinverse()
		NULL> 
	aMatrix <- makeCacheMatrix(1:4)
	>aMatrix$getinverse()
		NULL
	> aMatrix$set(5:20)
	> cacheSolve(aMatrix)
		Error in solve.default(data, ...) : 'a' (16 x 1) must be square
		Called from: solve.default(data, ...)
